Git stash command takes the dirty state of working directory,  modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.

Git reset command Reset current HEAD to the specified state. 
In general, git reset’s function is to take the current branch and reset it to point somewhere else, and possibly bring the index and work tree along.

Cherry picking in git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.
It can be done if you e.g. made a mistake and committed a change into wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can just e.g. revert the commit and cherry-pick it on another branch.
Make sure you are on the branch you want apply the commit to.
git checkout master
Execute the following:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash

Git rm Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory.
